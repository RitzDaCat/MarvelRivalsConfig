# MarvelRivalsConfig
This is my configuration for Marvel Rivals, goal is always to reduce performance overhead for a better experience while not completly destroying graphical fidelity.

## Installation ##
path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MarvelRivals\MarvelGame\Marvel\Config
1. create files userengine.ini and userinput.ini and put config contents in there.

## How can I know this work? ##
1. You can add r.RHIThread.Enable=0 and when the game starts it will immediately crash, this shows the contents were attempted to be loaded.
